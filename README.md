# Project-Pomodoro-Timer-Qualified-1

A pomodoro timer. 

The user can set the interval for two timers. A work timer and a break timer.

The work timer is always started first, and once started, it will continue until the set time has passed. After a sound, the break timer will start.

Either timer can be stopped at any point. Until the timer is stopped, the ability to change the intervals of time for each timer is relinquished from the user.

Either timer can also be temporarilt paused.
